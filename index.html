                <h2>BEST CHEESE EVER</h2>
            </div>
        <article>

            <P>I love cheese, especially who moved my cheese fromage frais. Danish fontinia boursin when the cheese comes out everbody's happy stilton cow macaroni cheese hard cheese smelly cheese. Stinking bishop cheesy fee cottage cheese stiltion cheeseburrger emmental creem cheese everyon loves. Jarlsberg fromage frais.</P>
            <p>Growing tired of copying cheese text so I'm going rogue. Though I've cut out milk I've been unable to cut the cheese. Ha Ha Ha. No seriously I love most cheese but tend to stay away from the really stinking ones. Goat cheese is not my favorite though for the most parts I do appriciate goats. Sheep cheese is pretty good. Frankly I have to say that cows put out the best cheese. Frankly I'm just glad I've grown out of the Kraft macaroni powdered cheese.</p>
            <p>Now gouda, there's a cheese. Especially aged gouda with its calcium lactate crystals. Great with apples and pears. Here's some info about gouda from wikipedia: The cheese is named after the Dutch city of Gouda, not because it is produced in or near the city, but because it has historically been traded there. In the Middle Ages, Dutch cities could obtain certain feudal rights which gave them primacy or a total monopoly on certain goods. Within the County of Holland it was Gouda which acquired the sole right to have a market in which the county's farmers could sell their cheese. It was at Gouda that all the cheeses would be laid onto the market square to sell. </p>
